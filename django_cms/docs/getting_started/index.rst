Welcome to django CMS 3. This tutorial should guide you  through the first basic steps with django
CMS all the way up to adding your own plugins and apps and extending the CMS' models itself!

    Should you run into trouble and can't figure out how to solve it yourself, you
    can get help from either our `mailinglist`_ or IRC channel ``#django-cms`` on
